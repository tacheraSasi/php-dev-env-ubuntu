# Complete Guide to Installing and Setting Up PHP, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin on Ubuntu

This guide will walk you through the process of installing Apache, PHP, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin on an Ubuntu system. Follow these steps to set up a basic development environment.

## **1. Install Apache, PHP, and MySQL**

### **Update Package List**

First, ensure your package list is up to date to avoid issues during installation.

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### **Install Apache**

Apache is a popular web server software. Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install apache2
```

After installation, Apache should start automatically. You can verify its status with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

### **Install PHP**

PHP is a server-side scripting language. To install PHP and the Apache PHP module, use:

```bash
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php
```

### **Install MySQL**

MySQL is a relational database management system. Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

After installation, MySQL should start automatically. Verify its status with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

## **2. Secure MySQL Installation**

### **Run the Security Script**

To secure your MySQL installation, run:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Follow the prompts to:
- **Set the MySQL root password.**
- **Remove test databases.**
- **Disallow remote root login.**
- **Reload privilege tables.**

## **3. Install phpMyAdmin**

### **Install phpMyAdmin**

phpMyAdmin provides a web interface to manage MySQL databases. Install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install phpmyadmin
```

### **Configure phpMyAdmin**

During installation:
- **Select `apache2` as the web server.**
- **Choose to configure a database for phpMyAdmin with `dbconfig-common`.**
- **Set a password for the phpMyAdmin user.**

### **Link phpMyAdmin to Apache (if needed)**

If phpMyAdmin is not automatically linked to Apache, create a symbolic link:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/html/phpmyadmin
```

### **Restart Apache**

Apply changes by restarting Apache:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## **4. Create a PHP Project**

### **Create a Project Directory**

Create a new directory for your PHP project and set proper permissions:

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/myproject
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/html/myproject
```

### **Create a Basic PHP File**

Navigate to your project directory and create a basic PHP file:

```bash
cd /var/www/html/myproject
nano index.php
```

Add the following PHP code to `index.php`:

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

Save and exit the editor (Ctrl+X, then Y, and Enter).

## **5. Access Your PHP Project**

### **Open Your Browser**

To view your PHP project, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost/myproject
```

You should see "Hello, World!" displayed.

## **6. Access phpMyAdmin**

### **Open phpMyAdmin**

To access phpMyAdmin, use:

```bash
xdg-open http://localhost/phpmyadmin
```

### **Log In**

- **Username:** `root`
- **Password:** Enter the MySQL root password you set during installation.

## **7. Basic MySQL Commands**

### **Log into MySQL**

Access MySQL with:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

### **Create a Database**

Create a new database with:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```

### **Create a New User and Grant Privileges**

Create a new MySQL user and grant privileges:

```sql
CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mydatabase.* TO 'myuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### **Exit MySQL**

Exit the MySQL prompt:

```sql
exit;
```

## **Additional Notes**

- **Check Service Status:** Ensure that both Apache and MySQL services are running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

- **Troubleshooting phpMyAdmin:** If you face issues with accessing phpMyAdmin, make sure it is correctly linked and that Apache is restarted.
